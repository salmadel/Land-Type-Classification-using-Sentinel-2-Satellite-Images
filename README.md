# Land-Type-Classification-using-Sentinel-2-Satellite-Images
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to classify different land types using **Sentinel-2 satellite images** and **deep 
learning techniques**. By analyzing RGB satellite imagery, we can accurately identify various 
land cover types, such as forests, water bodies, urban areas, and agricultural land. This 
classification can help in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and sustainable resource 
management. Our model will be trained using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and 
pretrained architectures to achieve high accuracy and robustness.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
â€¢ **Environmental Monitoring:** Tracks land cover changes over time, aiding in deforestation detection, climate change analysis, and natural disaster assessment.

â€¢ **Urban Planning:** Helps city planners analyze urban expansion and optimize land use for sustainable infrastructure development.

â€¢ **Agriculture Management:** Supports crop monitoring, identifies arable land, and enhances resource allocation to improve agricultural yield.

â€¢ **Disaster Response:** Provides critical insights for disaster management teams to assess affected areas and plan efficient recovery strategies.

â€¢ **Automation and Efficiency:** Reduces manual effort and enhances accuracy in land classification, enabling large-scale and cost-effective analysis.
